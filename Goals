Minimum Goals

we have done so far:
-pieces need to rotate
-one button instant drop to to bottom
-background grid
-show score
-draw pieces from images or live build them in the code
-end when next piece starts where a piece is placed
-highscores text file (sort highest to lowest?)
-pieces randomly selected for order (7 pieces)
-award points for row, more points for multiple rows via doubling
-show first next piece

still need to do:
-UI - say game over when lost then after a few seconds ask to record score
    - Tetris at top of screen somewhere

Ideal Goals (to be done once minimum have been met)
- hold piece
- show where piece will land
- flash points and how many rows were cleared
- game speeds up as level advances
- level graphic
- show highscores (sort them highest to lowest)
- statistics window for each block

Super Ideal
- integrate awesome 8-bit Russian music
- flashy explosions

Impossibly but Super Awesome
- 3D compatibility
